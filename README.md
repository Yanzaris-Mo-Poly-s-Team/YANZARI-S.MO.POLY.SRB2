# ヤンザリのモ・ポリ (Yanzari's Mo Poly)

[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-repo-blue?style=plastic&logo=github&label=Yanzari's%20Mo%20Poly)](https://github.com/Yanzaris-Mo-Poly-s-Team/YANZARI-S.MO.POLY.SRB2/)

リポジトリは英語ですが、いくつかを日本語に翻訳しました。 (The repository is in English, but I have translated some parts into Japanese.)\
A large and very good mod that will be reworked and made open source.

If you'd like to help, submit a Pull Request.

I know that if you have the source code, you'll be able to make add-ons that modify my mod.\
(I consider a mod to be a modification and an addon to be a mod that alters another mod.)

Requirements:\
• Sonic Robo Blast 2 v2.2.15
  
This mod cannot be redistributed.

Status:

    The open-source mod hasn't been cancelled,
    just temporarily paused until my computer is re-
    covered.
    I'm doing everything on my phone.

    When my computer is recovered,
    the repository will contain the Yanzari's Mo Poly 
    files from my PC.

    Play some SRB2 in multiplayer mode while eating a chili dog and have patience. 

    I wish you continued good health.

    I will still talk about it in the SRB2 workshop, but 
    I won't post anything about the mod. If you want 
    to contribute, wait until the status is okay. 

    When I recover it, the status will look like this: 
    "The Mod has been recovered, the Mod will be 
    uploaded to GitHub in an instant."

    I am really sorry about that.
