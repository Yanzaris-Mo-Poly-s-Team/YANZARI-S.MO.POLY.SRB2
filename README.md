## ➤ About the Mod

* This mod will be very complex, very cool, and fun;
it will have many characters and many DLCs.

### What are your plans for the mod?
* Characters:
  * Sonic from Sonic and the Fallen Star (Credits to StarDrop)
  * Tails from Sonic and the Fallen Star (Credits to StarDrop)
  * Amy from Sonic and the Moon Facility (Credits to StarDrop)
  * Alex from Super Cat Tales 2 (Credits to Neotronized)
 
* Map Themes:
  * Super Phantom Cat 2 (Credits to Veewo)
  * Super Cat Tales 2 (Credits to Neotronized)
  * Sonic and the Fallen Star (Credits to StarDrop)
  * Original Maps
  * Exclusive DLC Maps

* Hud
  * Themed Super Cat Tales 2 (Credits to Neotronized)
  * Themed Sonic and the Fallen Star (Credits to StarDrop)
  * Menus
    * Themed around Sonic and the Fallen Star and Super Cat Tales, with some original content.
    
* Sounds & Musics
  * Themes from Super Cat Tales 2, Sonic and the Fallen Star, etc.
  
* SRB2 Lua Scripts
  * All scripts were created by me and perhaps by others.
  * I will review the scripts you submit for your contributions.
    * If everything is alright, I will accept.
    * If everything isn't alright, I won't accept it.
 
### What else do you plan to include in the mod?
I plan to put a **lot of stuff** on it, I think the SRB2 will be able to handle it.

* Custom Character Selection Screen
* Customized Credits Screen
* Customized Player Setup Screen
* Customized Chat
* many DLCs
* A Command Prompt Instead of the SRB2 Console
* Recreating some functions of Lua 5.4
* Partitions
* Heavy File I/O Encryption!!
  * SQLite3, Aes, base64 and others
* LoadString (Lua 5.1)
* Load (Lua 5.4)
* Floating Numbers
* Classes
* SRB2 Thokker
* Menus so you don't have to mess with console variables.
* Yanzari's Mo Poly Table (`YanzMoPoly`) will no longer be accessible; only YMKP and YMSP will be available.
* Yanzari's Modding Kit Poly (YMKP)
  * ヤンザリの改造キット ポリ
  * Basically, an SDK (Software Development Kit).
  * a brief explanation: SDK (Software Development Kit) is a complete set of tools that allows developers to create, test, and integrate applications on a specific platform.
* Yanzari's Modding Space Poly (YMSP)
  * ヤンザリのモッディングスペースポリ
  * This will be a space where you can put functions, variables, constants, classes, hooks, etc. Everything your mod stores must be in this space.
  * Example to create (if YMKP is implemented): `YMKP:AddSpace(name : string)`
* Among many other things that will make your game good.

### This shows a bit of scripting for YMKP.
This depends on whether **YMKP is fully added**:\
  Let's assume that this file is not init.lua:
    -- It will probably only work in the final version.
    local Mod = YMKP:AddSpace(spacename : string)
    Mod:Init(function(API)
      -- when the Space is Loaded
      -- Example
      -- You can only use what the API exposes.
      local Players = API:GetAllPlayers()
      local Log = API:GetLog()
        if Log
          Log:Print(text : string)
          local Player = Players:GetLocalPlayer()
          if (Player and Player:IsValid() and Player:GetMobj() and Player:GetMobj():IsValid()) ~= nil
            Log:Printf(Player : userdata : ymp_player_t, text : string)
          end
        end
       -- ...
    end)
    
    Mod:SetAttributes({
    -- Example
    ["Space"] = "LOL"
    -- Define the attributes of the Mod...
    },type : string) -- The type can be YAML, XML, or JSON, Mod:GetAttributes It will return a string in the way the type was defined.
    
    Mod:NetVars(function(Net)
      -- Example
      Net:Set(var) -- Variables to Synchronize
    end)
    
    Mod:Credits({
    -- Example
    "Yanzari",
    "You",
    -- other people
    })
    
    Mod:Freeslot({
    -- Example
    "MYSPRITE" = "SPRITE",
    --Freeslot Everything Here, Not Counting SkinColors
    })   
    
    local MySkinColor = Mod:Skincolor(skincolorname : string)
    -- Example
    MySkinColor:Set("name",name : string)
    MySkinColor:Set("colors",colors : table)
    MySkinColor:Set("Chat Color",chatcolor : string)
    MySkinColor:Set("Is Super Color?",supercolor : boolean)
    -- etc
    MySkinColor:Def() --Turn SkinColor
    
    Mod:MobjDef(mobjtype : string,{
    -- define the attributes
    })
    
    Mod:StateDef(state : string,{
    -- define the attributes
    })
    
    Mod:SoundDef(sound : string,{
    -- define the attributes
    })
    
    Mod:AddConstants({
    -- Example
    [Const : String] = Value : Any
    -- define the Constants and Its Values
    })
    
    Mod:Hook(hook : string,function(API : userdata,args)
      -- Example
      -- You can only use what the API exposes.
      local Mobjs = API:GetAllMobjs()
      local Mobj = Mobjs:GetByType(type : string)
      local Players = API:GetAllPlayers()
      local Player = Players:GetLocalPlayer()
      local SkinName = Player:GetSkinName()
      local ExpectedSkinName = skinname : string
      local Skin = API:GetSkinTableByName(Player:GetSkinName())
      local Const = Mod:GetConstants("Const")
      if SkinName == ExpectedSkinName
        local Log = API:GetLog()
        if Log
          Log:Print(text : string)
        end
        local Io = API:GetIO(privatekey : string, name : string : optional) -- Encrypted with AES!
        local File = nil
        local Write = nil
        local ModLog = Mod:GetMyLog()
          File = Io:Create(filename : string,mode)
          Write = File:Write(text : string) -- Encrypted with Base64 & ZLib!
          if Write:Writed() == true
            ModLog:Write(text : string)
          end
          if File:IsClosed() == true
            -- ...
          end
          if File:Type() == var : string
            -- ...
          end
          File:Sha256(File:Read("*a"))
      end
    end,extra : any : depends)
    
    local filename = Mod:Require(filename : string) -- returns an addonfile_t or nil
    local filename = Mod:Include(filename : string) -- returns an addonfile_t or error
    
    Mod:Exit(function(API)
    -- When the game performs an action considered to be closed
    -- an example
    local ExitType = API:GetExitType()
    if ExitType == "SRB2"
    elseif ExitType == "Kick"
      local KickReason = API:GetKickReason()
      if KickReaspn
      end
    end
    end)
    
    local GetMySpace = YMKP:GetSpace(spacename : string) -- so you can get your space back.
    
When the Mod is fully loaded via init.lua, if you want the Space to be private:
    YMKP:SetSpacePrivate(spacename : string)

Load the Mod via init.lua

### What is the purpose of this mod?
It's a mod that gets stuck in your memory because it's so good,\
and I also want to know if **SRB2 is capable**\
**of running complex things.**

### How much storage does it consume?
more than **1GB**.

### Will there be a sequel?
Yes. It was called "**Yanzari's Lost Island**"\
The sequel will be... MUCH better.

### Will the mod support other mods?
**Yes**, full support.

#### Will there be a Wiki?
we will have **YWikiPedia**,\
there, there will be documentation of Yanzari's Mo Poly and Yanzari's Mo Poly++.

#### Will it support SRB2VR and SRB2Mobile?
**yes**, SRB2VR and SRB2Mobile supported Yanzari's Mo Poly, however...\
it requires SRB2 2.2.15.

You will need to have the SRB2VR version of SRB2 2.2.15,\
if it exists; otherwise, you will have to create a version of SRB2VR for SRB2 2.2.15. 

### Bugs
When you started a multiplayer server and someone joined,\
it would cause your game to crash.

---

I know that if you have the source code, you'll be able to make add-ons that modify my mod.\
(I consider a mod to be a modification and an addon to be a mod that alters another mod.)

Requirements:\
• Sonic Robo Blast 2 v2.2.15
  
This mod cannot be redistributed Unofficially, parts of the project may be distributed, but not the entire mod.

## ➤ Status

    The open-source mod hasn't been cancelled,
    just temporarily paused until my computer is re-
    covered.
    I'm doing everything on my phone.

    When my computer is recovered,
    the repository will contain the Yanzari's Mo Poly 
    files from my PC.

    Play some SRB2 in multiplayer mode while eating a chili dog and have patience. 

    I wish you continued good health.

    I will still talk about it in the SRB2 workshop, but 
    I won't post anything about the mod. If you want 
    to contribute, wait until the status is okay. 

    When I recover it, the status will look like this: 
    "The Mod has been recovered, the Mod will be 
    uploaded to GitHub in an instant."

    I am really sorry about that.
